# Supermarket_management_System

## This project made during my "introduction to operating systems" course.

### Subject that this project deal with:
    * Data types and Conversion.
    * Variables and constants.
    * Functions. 
    * Random Number.
    * Standard Libraries.
    * Pointers and pointers arithmetics.
    * Strings.
    * Structures.
    * Union & enum.
    * Dynamic allocations.
    * Pointer to functions.
    * Binary Files + text file
    * Bitwise operators.
    * Bit fields in structures.
    * Linked lists.
	* Macros.
    * Parameters to main.
    * Variadic functions.
    
## Project explenation:

* Functions that must be implemented in each struct:
    * Receiving values from the user function.
    * Printing function.
    * Allocation free function if needed.
    * Functions that will enable the correct implementation of the system as 
      will be explained later while thinking correctly about a proper software 
      structure as learned in the object-oriented programming course.
      
* In the first part of the project we were asked to do the following:
    * Create Address struct with the fieldes:
      - House number.
      - Dynamic string for street, can be made with several words and in unknown size
      - Dynamic string for city, can be made with several words and in unknown size.
      
    * Create _Product_ struct with the fieldes:
    
    *
